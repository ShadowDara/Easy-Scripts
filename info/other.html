# Calender Week 11 - 11 March 2025

# Slothbytes Newsletter Challenge - Hidden Calculater Words
<br>
# submit by Shadowdara
<br>
# written in Python
<br>
# 
<br>
# check out my Github Profile please

<br>
#
<br>
# I am sure this would be possible a lot less complicated,
<br>
# but i like it to complicate simple things
<br>
#
<br>
# Yeah, you need to install Python to run this script!
<br>
#
<br>
# And to be honest, i am really sure what the challenge was,
<br>
# maybe it is although finding other words you can write with
<br>
# just numbers, that has nothing to do with coding,
<br>
# so I ended up with this idea.
<br>
#
<br>
# and i am not sure if 9 is not possible are used as "space",
<br>
# but 9 will work in this script and covert it to a "-"
<br>
#
<br>
# Python is btw my favourite prgramming language

<br>
# to be honest i am not sure when i started, but i am defenetly
<br>
# sitting here a lot longer. (Now its 5:21 pm)
<br>
# i suck at coding lol
<br>
# i want to learn Java for Minecraft Mods
<br>
# but python is way easier so always end up with python
<br>
#
<br>
# D:
<br>
#
<br>
# I know my Version is a lot overkill and i wasted defenetly to
<br>
# much time for things nobody would ever care about, but at least
<br>
# i had a bit of fun thinking about thess problems!
<br>
# when you are not completly helpless, is programming mostly fun
<br>
#
<br>
# Sorry for all this comment spam, but i need this to not getting
<br>
# crazy lol!
<br>
#
<br>
# The next time i will do this in Java or Scala because i think
<br>
# this would be much harder!
<br>
#
<br>
# I am FINISHED and its now 6.05 pm
<br>
# this took so much time 
<br>
# D:
<br>
#
<br>
# I hope nobody reads this all lol
