# Scipt Tools

this is the Repository for the github website of some of my own written guides.

In the Folder `src`, there is although a file, named `#Guide_Main.html`. It contains more detailed intructions about the single scripts and projects. To read it, first download it and open it in your browser.

Open the website [here]() for more information!
